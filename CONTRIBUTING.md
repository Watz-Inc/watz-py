## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/watz-inc/watz-py/issues).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to request a feature

Request features on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/watz-inc/watz-py/issues).

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/) installed.

Install the package with development requirements:
`pdm install` to setup for the first time
`pdm venv activate` to activate the virtual environment (whenever you open the project to work)

### Running tests

- `pdm run nox` to run all sessions
- `pdm run nox -s qa` to run everything that runs on a git commit, plus `pyright`
- `pdm run nox -s test` to run tests
- `pdm run nox -s coverage` for a coverage report based on the last `test` session run
- `pdm run nox -s docs -- serve` to build the docs and run a local copy at `http://localhost:8000`

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.
